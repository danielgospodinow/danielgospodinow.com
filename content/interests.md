So, here's my story.

I've been programming and learning new things related to IT since I was around 15 years old.

I was a gamer back then and great games started and kept driving my passion for code. It all began with writing macros for "World of Warcraft", a game that I loved playing.

In high school, I realized that the disciplines I love were Programming, Physics, and Maths because I imagined how all of that can be used to build a video game. That was a clear sign that I'm more of an engineering type of person. During my high school education, I've attended a lot of IT academies and competitions and had excellent results on every single one of them. This I greatly owe to my unique Informatics teacher - Dobrinka Doneva.

Later into my IT journey, I found that electronics and IoT are also a thing that I love.

As of now, I'm studying Computer Science, working as a full-time software engineer, meeting new people, learning new things all of the time and enjoying my life.
