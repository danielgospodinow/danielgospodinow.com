Hey there! 👋

## Who Am I?

🏃 I'm Daniel Gospodinow, a twentyish male born in Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria 🇧🇬 who's on his journey to get the best from life by employing his full potential of social and technical skills.

🧑‍💻 Currently, I work as a full-time software developer at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/) in Sofia, Bulgaria. 

👨‍🎓 Also, I'm a final-year Bachelor's in Computer Science at [Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/).

🕒 In my free time, I love
- 📖 learning new stuff.
- 💻 writing code, as seen from the [Projects](../projects) section and from [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/danielgospodinow).
- ✍️ writing tech articles for [my blog](https://medium.com/@danielgospodinow).
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 hanging out with friends.
- 🎮 playing video games on my PC or Playstation.

⭐ I wish to
- 🤵 become an outstanding developer, investor, entrepreneur, teacher, and an overall successful man. A man who people admire and love. A man who motivates others around him to also follow their goals and dreams.
- 👧 have a healthy, smart, and ambitious daughter one day; 👩 and to again have a loyal, fun, supportive, and loving partner.
- 🏢 experience working abroad in a big company like [Google](), [Microsoft](), [Apple](), [Netflix](), etc.
- 💲 have my own commercial software product(s) and course(s).
- 👞 be a stylish man.
- 🏠 have a [wonderful modern home](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/8d/f1/298df1cac168231b7572f2b4e75a269c.jpg).
- 🚘 drive a [luxury saloon car](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mbsocialcar/mbsocialcar-s-class/_jcr_content/root/slider_4/sliderchilditems/slideritem_3/image/MQ7-0-image-20190114134133/04-mercedes-benz-vehicles-mbsocialcar-v-222-s-class-3400x1440.jpeg).

🔮 In the future, I plan to
- 💼 continue my university education with a Master's degree by diving into a new field - IT entrepreneurship. I believe that the skills that can be potentially acquired by such a Master's degree can help me a lot in my professional and even non-professional life. Business-oriented skills can never be useless.
- 👬 meet countless new smart and ambitious people.
- 🌎 try living abroad for a while. Somewhere in Western Europe 🇨🇭 or in the USA 🇺🇸. I want to taste foreign cultures.
- ✅ turn my wishes and dreams into goals and then achieve them.
